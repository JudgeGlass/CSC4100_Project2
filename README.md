# Project 2 - CSC4200

## Getting started

To make development easier, I have converted the pintos VM into a docker container. 

With docker installed, run

``` bash
make docker
```

## Running tests

``` bash
make docker-check
```

## Running threads

``` bash
make run-threads
```

## Other targets

Just look at the Makefile
